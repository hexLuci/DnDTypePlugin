# DnDTypePlugin
Welcome to a DnD type plugin\. I'm making this purely for fun\. Hopefully it will have all of the stats, ways to level them up and possibly other things\.

# Features
* The stat Strength affects the player\'s damage\. It is currently worked out by damage \Ã— strength, but that will be changed\.
* The stat Dexterity affects the player\'s speed\. It is currently ranged between 0\.1 to 1, 0\.2 being the default\. 
* The stat Constitution affects the player\'s health\. It is currently 100\.0D \(D is a [Double](https://www.javatpoint.com/double-keyword-in-java#:~:text=The%20Java%20double%20keyword%20is,generally%20represents%20the%20decimal%20numbers.)\)
* The player\'s health is shown as an action bar \(above the player's health\)\.

# Commands
* Heal
    * Heals the user\'s full health and hunger\.
* ShowStats
    * Shows the user\'s stats\. Currently unformatted\.
